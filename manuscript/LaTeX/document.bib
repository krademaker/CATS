abstract = {About 20{\%} of breast cancers are characterized by amplification and overexpression of the HER2 oncogene. Although significant progress has been achieved for treating such patients with HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab, more than half of the patients respond poorly or become resistant to the treatment. Since the HER2 amplicon at 17q12 contains multiple genes, we have systematically explored the role of the HER2 co-amplified genes in breast cancer cell growth and their relation to trastuzumab resistance. We integrated aCGH data of the HER2 amplicon from 71 HER2 positive breast tumors and 10 cell lines with systematic functional RNA interference analysis of 23 core amplicon genes with several phenotypic endpoints in a panel of trastuzumab responding and non-responding HER2 positive breast cancer cells. Silencing of HER2 caused a greater growth arrest and apoptosis in the responding compared to the non-responding cell lines, indicating that the resistant cells are inherently less dependent on the HER2 pathway. Several other genes in the amplicon also showed a more pronounced effect when silenced; indicating that expression of HER2 co-amplified genes may be needed to sustain the growth of breast cancer cells. Importantly, co-silencing of STARD3, GRB7, PSMD3 and PERLD1 together with HER2 led to an additive inhibition of cell viability as well as induced apoptosis. These studies indicate that breast cancer cells may become addicted to the amplification of several genes that reside in the HER2 amplicon. The simultaneous targeting of these genes may increase the efficacy of the anti-HER2 therapies and possibly also counteract trastuzumab resistance. The observed additive effects seem to culminate to both apoptosis and cell proliferation pathways indicating that these pathways may be interesting targets for combinatorial treatment of HER2+ breast cancers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is a common and threatening malignant disease with multiple biological and clinical subtypes. It can be categorized into subtypes of luminal A, luminal B, Her2 positive, and basal-like. Copy number variants (CNVs) have been reported to be a potential and even better biomarker for cancer diagnosis than mRNA biomarkers, because it is considerably more stable and robust than gene expression. Thus, it is meaningful to detect CNVs of different cancers. To identify the CNV biomarker for breast cancer subtypes, we integrated the CNV data of more than 2000 samples from two large breast cancer databases, METABRIC and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A Monte Carlo feature selection-based and incremental feature selection-based computational method was proposed and tested to identify the distinctive core CNVs in different breast cancer subtypes. We identified the CNV genes that may contribute to breast cancer tumorigenesis as well as built a set of quantitative distinctive rules for recognition of the breast cancer subtypes. The tenfold cross-validation Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) on METABRIC training set and the independent test on TCGA dataset were 0.515 and 0.492, respectively. The CNVs of PGAP3, GRB7, MIR4728, PNMT, STARD3, TCAP and ERBB2 were important for the accurate diagnosis of breast cancer subtypes. The findings reported in this study may further uncover the difference between different breast cancer subtypes and improve the diagnosis accuracy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The discovery of functional non-coding RNA sequences has
    led to an increasing interest in algorithms related to RNA analysis.
    Traditional sequence alignment algorithms, however, fail at computing
    reliable alignments of low-homology RNA sequences. The spatial conformation
    of RNA sequences largely determines their function, and therefore
    RNA alignment algorithms have to take structural information into
    account. RESULTS: We present a graph-based representation for sequence-structure
    alignments, which we model as an integer linear program (ILP). We
    sketch how we compute an optimal or near-optimal solution to the
    ILP using methods from combinatorial optimization, and present results
    on a recently published benchmark set for RNA alignments. CONCLUSION:
    The implementation of our algorithm yields better alignments in terms
    of two published scores than the other programs that we tested: This
    is especially the case with an increasing number of input sequences.

  abstract = {We propose an improved version of the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm
    of Saitou and Nei. This new algorithm, BIONJ, follows the same agglomerative
    scheme as NJ, which consists of iteratively picking a pair of taxa,
    creating a new mode which represents the cluster of these taxa, and
    reducing the distance matrix by replacing both taxa by this node.
    Moreover, BIONJ uses a simple first-order model of the variances
    and covariances of evolutionary distance estimates. This model is
    well adapted when these estimates are obtained from aligned sequences.
    At each step it permits the selection, from the class of admissible
    reductions, of the reduction which minimizes the variance of the
    new distance matrix. In this way, we obtain better estimates to choose
    the pair of taxa to be agglomerated during the next steps. Moreover,
    in comparison with NJ's estimates, these estimates become better
    and better as the algorithm proceeds. BIONJ retains the good properties
    of NJ--especially its low run time. Computer simulations have been
    performed with 12-taxon model trees to determine BIONJ's efficiency.
    When the substitution rates are low (maximum pairwise divergence
    approximately 0.1 substitutions per site) or when they are constant
    among lineages, BIONJ is only slightly better than NJ. When the substitution
    rates are higher and vary among lineages,BIONJ clearly has better
    topological accuracy. In the latter case, for the model trees and
    the conditions of evolution tested, the topological error reduction
    is on the average around 20\%. With highly-varying-rate trees and
    with high substitution rates (maximum pairwise divergence approximately
    1.0 substitutions per site), the error reduction may even rise above
    50\%, while the probability of finding the correct tree may be augmented
    by as much as 15\%.},

  title = {Phylogenetic reconstruction using secondary structures of Internal
    Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2, rDNA): finding the molecular and morphological
    gap in Caribbean gorgonian corals.},
  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {90},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most phylogenetic studies using current methods have focused
    on primary DNA sequence information. However, RNA secondary structures
    are particularly useful in systematics because they include characteristics,
    not found in the primary sequence, that give "morphological" information.
    Despite the number of recent molecular studies on octocorals, there
    is no consensus opinion about a region that carries enough phylogenetic
    resolution to solve intrageneric or close species relationships.
    Moreover, intrageneric morphological information by itself does not
    always produce accurate phylogenies; intra-species comparisons can
    reveal greater differences than intra-generic ones. The search for
    new phylogenetic approaches, such as by RNA secondary structure analysis,
    is therefore a priority in octocoral research. RESULTS: Initially,
    twelve predicted RNA secondary structures were reconstructed to provide
    the basic information for phylogenetic analyses; they accorded with
    the 6 helicoidal ring model, also present in other groups of corals
    and eukaryotes. We obtained three similar topologies for nine species
    of the Caribbean gorgonian genus Eunicea (candelabrum corals) with
    two sister taxa as outgroups (genera Plexaura and Pseudoplexaura)
    on the basis of molecular morphometrics of ITS2 RNA secondary structures
    only, traditional primary sequence analyses and maximum likelihood,
    and a Bayesian analysis of the combined data. The latter approach
    allowed us to include both primary sequence and RNA molecular morphometrics;
    each data partition was allowed to have a different evolution rate.
    In addition, each helix was partitioned as if it had evolved at a
    distinct rate. Plexaura flexuosa was found to group within Eunicea;
    this was best supported by both the molecular morphometrics and combined
    analyses. We suggest Eunicea flexuosa (Lamouroux, 1821) comb. nov.,
    and we present a new species description including Scanning Electron
    Microscopy (SEM) images of morphological characteristics (sclerites).
    Eunicea flexuosa, E. pallida, E. laxispica and E. mammosa formed
    a separate clade in the molecular phylogenies, and were reciprocally
    monophyletic with respect to other Eunicea (Euniceopsis subgenus,
    e.g. E. tourneforti and E. laciniata) in the molecular morphometrics
    tree, with the exception of E. fusca. Moreover, we suggest a new
    diagnostic character for Eunicea, also present in E. flexuosa: middle
    layer sclerites > 1 mm in length. CONCLUSION: ITS2 was a reliable
    sequence for intrageneric studies in gorgonian octocorals because
    of the amount of phylogenetic signal, and was corroborated against
    morphological characters separating Eunicea from Plexaura. The ITS2
    RNA secondary structure approach to phylogeny presented here did
    not rely on alignment methods such as INDELS, but provided clearly
    homologous characters for partition analysis and RNA molecular morphometrics.
    These approaches support the divergence of Eunicea flexuosa comb.

    part of this outgroup for nearly two centuries because of morphological

    the tree alignment model, which is suitable to cluster RNA molecules

  abstract = {The estimation of amino acid replacement frequencies during molecular
    evolution is crucial for many applications in sequence analysis.
    Score matrices for database search programs or phylogenetic analysis
    rely on such models of protein evolution. Pioneering work was done
    by Dayhoff et al. (1978) who formulated a Markov model of evolution
    and derived the famous PAM score matrices. Her estimation procedure
    for amino acid exchange frequencies is restricted to pairs of proteins
    that have a constant and small degree of divergence. Here we present
    an improved estimator, called the resolvent method, that is not subject
    to these limitations. This extension of Dayhoff's approach enables
    us to estimate an amino acid substitution model from alignments of
    varying degree of divergence. Extensive simulations show the capability
    of the new estimator to recover accurately the exchange frequencies
    among amino acids. Based on the SYSTERS database of aligned protein
    families (Krause and Vingron, 1998) we recompute a series of score
    matrices.},

  abstract = {The ongoing characterization of novel species creates the need for
    a molecular marker which can be used for species- and, simultaneously,
    for mega-systematics. Recently, the use of the internal transcribed
    spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence was suggested, as it shows a high divergence
    in sequence with an assumed conservation in structure. This hypothesis
    was mainly based on small-scale analyses, comparing a limited number
    of sequences. Here, we report a large-scale analysis of more than
    54,000 currently known ITS2 sequences with the goal to evaluate the
    hypothesis of a conserved structural core and to assess its use for
    automated large-scale phylogenetics. Structure prediction revealed
    that the previously described core structure can be found for more
    than 5000 sequences in a wide variety of taxa within the eukaryotes,
    indicating that the core secondary structure is indeed conserved.
    This conserved structure allowed an automated alignment of extremely
    divergent sequences as exemplified for the ITS2 sequences of a ctenophorean
    eumetazoon and a volvocalean green alga. All classified sequences,
    together with their structures can be accessed at http://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/bioinformatik/projects/ITS2.html.
    Furthermore, we found that, although sample sequences are known for
    most major taxa, there exists a profound divergence in coverage,
    which might become a hindrance for general usage. In summary, our
    analysis strengthens the potential of ITS2 as a general phylogenetic
    marker and provides a data source for further ITS2-based analyses.},

    clear, that the ITS2 might be useful even for higher level systematic
    analyses. As the secondary structure is highly conserved within all
    eukaryotes it serves as a valuable template for the construction
    of highly reliable sequence-structure alignments, which build a fundament
    for subsequent analyses. Thus, any phylogenetic study using ITS2
    has to consider both sequence and structure. We have integrated a
    homology based RNA structure prediction algorithm into a web server,
    which allows the detection and secondary structure prediction for
    ITS2 in any given sequence. Furthermore, the resource contains more
    than 25,000 pre-calculated secondary structures for the currently

    alignment and editing.}},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {498},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In sequence analysis the multiple alignment builds the
    fundament of all proceeding analyses. Errors in an alignment could
    strongly influence all succeeding analyses and therefore could lead
    to wrong predictions. Hand-crafted and hand-improved alignments are
    necessary and meanwhile good common practice. For RNA sequences often
    the primary sequence as well as a secondary structure consensus is
    well known, e.g., the cloverleaf structure of the t-RNA. Recently,
    some alignment editors are proposed that are able to include and
    model both kinds of information. However, with the advent of a large
    amount of reliable RNA sequences together with their solved secondary
    structures (available from e.g. the ITS2 Database), we are faced
    with the problem to handle sequences and their associated secondary
    structures synchronously. RESULTS: 4SALE fills this gap. The application
    allows a fast sequence and synchronous secondary structure alignment
    for large data sets and for the first time synchronous manual editing
    of aligned sequences and their secondary structures. This study describes
    an algorithm for the synchronous alignment of sequences and their
    associated secondary structures as well as the main features of 4SALE
    used for further analyses and editing. 4SALE builds an optimal and
    unique starting point for every RNA sequence and structure analysis.
    CONCLUSION: 4SALE, which provides an user-friendly and intuitive
    interface, is a comprehensive toolbox for RNA analysis based on sequence
    and secondary structure information. The program connects sequence
    and structure databases like the ITS2 Database to phylogeny programs
    as for example the CBCAnalyzer. 4SALE is written in JAVA and therefore
    platform independent. The software is freely available and distributed

    different species from each other. Despite its importance, the correct
    structure is only rarely found by standard RNA folding algorithms.
    To overcome this hindrance for a wider application of the ITS2, we
    have developed a homology modelling approach to predict the structure

    into a multiple alignment and second, how to generate secondary structure
    information for sequences whose explicit structural information is
    missing. RESULTS: We describe a novel approach for multiple alignment
    of RNAs (MARNA) taking into consideration both the primary and the
    secondary structures. It is based on pairwise sequence-structure
    comparisons of RNAs. From these sequence-structure alignments, libraries
    of weighted alignment edges are generated. The weights reflect the
    sequential and structural conservation. For sequences whose secondary
    structures are missing, the libraries are generated by sampling low
    energy conformations. The libraries are then processed by the T-Coffee
    system, which is a consistency based multiple alignment method. Furthermore,
    we are able to extract a consensus-sequence and -structure from a
    multiple alignment. We have successfully tested MARNA on several

  abstract = {Empirical models of substitution are often used in protein sequence
    analysis because the large alphabet of amino acids requires that
    many parameters be estimated in all but the simplest parametric models.
    When information about structure is used in the analysis of substitutions
    in structured RNA, a similar situation occurs. The number of parameters
    necessary to adequately describe the substitution process increases
    in order to model the substitution of paired bases. We have developed
    a method to obtain substitution rate matrices empirically from RNA
    alignments that include structural information in the form of base
    pairs. Our data consisted of alignments from the European Ribosomal
    RNA Database of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Small Subunit and Large
    Subunit Ribosomal RNA ( Wuyts et al. 2001. Nucleic Acids Res. 29:175-177;
    Wuyts et al. 2002. Nucleic Acids Res. 30:183-185). Using secondary
    structural information, we converted each sequence in the alignments
    into a sequence over a 20-symbol code: one symbol for each of the
    four individual bases, and one symbol for each of the 16 ordered
    pairs. Substitutions in the coded sequences are defined in the natural
    way, as observed changes between two sequences at any particular
    site. For given ranges (windows) of sequence divergence, we obtained
    substitution frequency matrices for the coded sequences. Using a
    technique originally developed for modeling amino acid substitutions
    ( Veerassamy, Smith, and Tillier. 2003. J. Comput. Biol. 10:997-1010),
    we were able to estimate the actual evolutionary distance for each
    window. The actual evolutionary distances were used to derive instantaneous
    rate matrices, and from these we selected a universal rate matrix.
    The universal rate matrices were incorporated into the Phylip Software
    package ( Felsenstein 2002. http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html),
    and we analyzed the ribosomal RNA alignments using both distance
    and maximum likelihood methods. The empirical substitution models
    performed well on simulated data, and produced reasonable evolutionary
    trees for 16S ribosomal RNA sequences from sequenced Bacterial genomes.
    Empirical models have the advantage of being easily implemented,
    and the fact that the code consists of 20 symbols makes the models
    easily incorporated into existing programs for protein sequence analysis.
    In addition, the models are useful for simulating the evolution of
    RNA sequence and structure simultaneously.},

abstract = {Motivation: Microarray gene expression data are increasingly employed to identify sets of marker genes that accurately predict disease development and outcome in cancer. Many computational approaches have been proposed to construct such predictors. However, there is, as yet, no objective way to evaluate whether a new approach truly improves on the current state of the art. In addition no 'standard' computational approach has emerged which enables robust outcome prediction. Results: An important contribution of this work is the description of a principled training and validation protocol, which allows objective evaluation of the complete methodology for constructing a predictor. We review the possible choices of computational approaches, with specific emphasis on predictor choice and reporter selection strategies. Employing this training-validation protocol, we evaluated different reporter selection strategies and predictors on six gene expression datasets of varying degrees of difficulty. We demonstrate that simple reporter selection strategies (forward filtering and shrunken centroids) work surprisingly well and outperform partial least squares in four of the six datasets. Similarly, simple predictors, such as the nearest mean classifier, outperform more complex classifiers. Our training-validation protocol provides a robust methodology to evaluate the performance of new computational approaches and to objectively compare outcome predictions on different datasets. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005.

abstract = {Motivation: Array CGH technologies enable the simultaneous measurement of DNA copy number for thousands of sites on a genome. We developed the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to divide the genome into regions of equal copy number. The algorithm tests for change-points using a maximal t-statistic with a permutation reference distribution to obtain the corresponding P-value. The number of computations required for the maximal test statistic is O(N2), where N is the number of markers. This makes the full permutation approach computationally prohibitive for the newer arrays that contain tens of thousands markers and highlights the need for a faster algorithm. Results: We present a hybrid approach to obtain the P-value of the test statistic in linear time. We also introduce a rule for stopping early when there is strong evidence for the presence of a change. We show through simulations that the hybrid approach provides a substantial gain in speed with only a negligible loss in accuracy and that the stopping rule further increases speed. We also present the analyses of array CGH data from breast cancer cell lines to show the impact of the new approaches on the analysis of real data. {\textcopyright} 2007 Oxford University Press.},

Here we report the identification of 2,576 somatic mutations across g∼1/41,800-megabases of DNA representing 1,507 coding genes from 441 tumours comprising breast, lung, ovarian and prostate cancer types and subtypes. We found that mutation rates and the sets of mutated genes varied substantially across tumour types and subtypes. Statistical analysis identified 77 significantly mutated genes including protein kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors such as GRM8, BAI3, AGTRL1 (also called APLNR) and LPHN3, and other druggable targets. Integrated analysis of somatic mutations and copy number alterations identified another 35 significantly altered genes including GNAS, indicating an expanded role for g$\gamma$ ± subunits in multiple cancer types. Furthermore, our experimental analyses demonstrate the functional roles of mutant GNAO1 (a G$\gamma$ ± subunit) and mutant MAP2K4 (a member of the JNK signalling pathway) in oncogenesis. Our study provides an overview of the mutational spectra across major human cancers and identifies several potential therapeutic targets. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80{\%} of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy. {\textcopyright} 2002 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.},

@ARTICLE{VanDenBroek2015,
abstract = {Background: Cancer is caused by somatic DNA alterations such as gene point mutations, DNA copy number aberrations (CNA) and structural variants (SVs). Genome-wide analyses of SVs in large sample series with well-documented clinical information are still scarce. Consequently, the impact of SVs on carcinogenesis and patient outcome remains poorly understood. This study aimed to perform a systematic analysis of genes that are affected by CNA-associated chromosomal breaks in colorectal cancer (CRC) and to determine the clinical relevance of recurrent breakpoint genes. Methods: Primary CRC samples of patients with metastatic disease from CAIRO and CAIRO2 clinical trials were previously characterized by array-comparative genomic hybridization. These data were now used to determine the prevalence of CNA-associated chromosomal breaks within genes across 352 CRC samples. In addition, mutation status of the commonly affected APC, TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, FBXW7, SMAD4, BRAF and NRAS genes was determined for 204 CRC samples by targeted massive parallel sequencing. Clinical relevance was assessed upon stratification of patients based on gene mutations and gene breakpoints that were observed in {\textgreater}3{\%} of CRC cases. Results: In total, 748 genes were identified that were recurrently affected by chromosomal breaks (FDR {\textgreater}0.1). MACROD2 was affected in 41{\%}of CRC samples and another 169 genes showed breakpoints in {\textgreater}3{\%} of cases, indicating that prevalence of gene breakpoints is comparable to the prevalence of well-known gene point mutations. Patient stratification based on gene breakpoints and point mutations revealed one CRC subtype with very poor prognosis. Conclusions: We conclude that CNA-associated chromosomal breaks within genes represent a highly prevalent and clinically relevant subset of SVs in CRC.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

We evaluated several variable selection procedures based on simulated data as well as publicly available experimental methylation and gene expression data. Our comparison included the Boruta algorithm, the Vita method, recurrent relative variable importance, a permutation approach and its parametric variant (Altmann) as well as recursive feature elimination (RFE). {\^{a}} €f In our simulation studies, Boruta was the most powerful approach, followed closely by the Vita method. Both approaches demonstrated similar stability in variable selection, while Vita was the most robust approach under a pure null model without any predictor variables related to the outcome. In the analysis of the different experimental data sets, Vita demonstrated slightly better stability in variable selection and was less computationally intensive than Boruta. In conclusion, we recommend the Boruta and Vita approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional data sets. Vita is considerably faster than Boruta and thus more suitable for large data sets, but only Boruta can also be applied in low-dimensional settings.},

@ARTICLE{Blanke2014,
abstract = {Purpose: Cytochrome b5(encoded by CYB5A) and NADH cytochrome b5reductase (encoded by CYB5R3) detoxify aromatic and heterocyclic amine mammary carcinogens found in cigarette smoke. We hypothesized that CYB5A and CYB5R3 polymorphisms would be associated with breast cancer risk in women.
Methods: We characterized the prevalence of 18 CYB5A and CYB5R3 variants in genomic DNA from African American (AfrAm) and Caucasian (Cauc) women from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study population (1,946 cases and 1,747 controls) and determined their associations with breast cancer risk, with effect modification by smoking.
Results: A CYB5R3 variant, I1M+6T (rs8190370), was significantly more common in breast cancer cases (MAF 0.0238) compared with controls (0.0169, p = 0.039); this was attributable to a higher MAF in AfrAm cases (0.0611) compared with AfrAm controls (0.0441, p = 0.046; adjusted OR 1.41, CI 0.98–2.04; p = 0.062). When smoking was considered, I1M+6T was more strongly associated with breast cancer risk in AfrAm smokers (adjusted OR 2.10, 1.08–4.07; p = 0.028) compared with never smokers (OR = 1.21; 0.77–1.88; p for interaction = 0.176). I1M+6T and three additional CYB5R3 variants, -251T, I8-1676C, and *392C, as well as two CYB5A variants, 13G and I2-992T, were significantly more common in AfrAms compared with Caucs.
Conclusions: CYB5R3 I1M+6C{\textgreater}T should be considered in future molecular epidemiologic studies of breast cancer risk in AfrAms. Further, variants in CYB5A and CYB5R3 should be considered in the evaluation of other tumors in AfrAms that are associated with aromatic and heterocyclic amine exposures, to include prostate, bladder, and colon cancers.},

@ARTICLE{Wu2017,
abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of interactions between TGF-$\beta$ and Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathways that induce and regulate EMT and promote breast cancer cells to become resistant to treatment. Methods: The effect of TGF-$\beta$ on Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway was examined by using a human Wnt/$\beta$-catenin-regulated cDNA plate array and western blot analysis. The interaction of Twist at promoter of Wnt3 was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Secreted Wnt3 level was determined by ELISA assay. Results: HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells treated with TGF-$\beta$ have a reduced response to trastuzumab and exhibited EMT-like phenotype. The TGF-$\beta$-induced EMT in HER2-cells was concordant with upregulation of Wnt3 and $\beta$-catenin pathways. The TGF-$\beta$-induced induction of Wnt3 during EMT was found to be Smad3-dependent. ChIP analysis identified occupancy of Twist at promoter region of Wnt3. Knock-down of Twist by shRNA confirmed the significance of Twist in response to TGF-$\beta$ regulating Wnt3 during EMT. Subsequently, TGF-$\beta$-induced matrix metalloproteinases, MMP1, MMP7, MMP9, MMP26, Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), and activation of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling were repressed by the shRNA treatment. TGF-$\beta$R1 ALK5 kinase inhibitor, A83-01 can effectively prevent the TGF-$\beta$-induced Twist and Wnt3. Co-treating A83-01 and trastuzumab inhibited TGF-$\beta$-induced cell invasion significantly in both trastuzumab responsive and resistant cells. Conclusions: Our data demonstrated an important interdependence between TGF-$\beta$ and Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathways inducing EMT in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Twist served as a linkage between the two pathways during TGF-$\beta$-induced EMT. A83-01 could inhibit the TGF-$\beta$-initiated pathway interactions and enhance HER2-cells response to trastuzumab treatment.},

@ARTICLE{Lund2015,
abstract = {Metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related deaths and remains the most significant challenge to management of the disease. Metastases are established through a complex multistep process involving intracellular signaling pathways. To gain insight to proteins central to specific steps in metastasis formation, we used a metastasis cell line model that allows investigation of extravasation and colonization of circulating cancer cells to lungs in mice. Using stable isotopic labeling by amino acids in cell culture and subcellular fractionation, the nuclear, cytosol, and mitochondria proteomes were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, identifying a number of proteins that exhibited altered expression in isogenic metastatic versus nonmetastatic cancer cell lines, including NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3), L-lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), Niemannpick c1 protein (NPC1), and nucleolar RNA helicase 2 (NRH2). The altered expression levels were validated at the protein and transcriptional levels, and analysis of breast cancer biopsies from two cohorts of patients demonstrated a significant correlation between high CYB5R3 expression and poor disease-free and overall survival in patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumors (DFS: p =.02, OS: p =.04). CYB5R3 gene knockdown using siRNA in metastasizing cells led to significantly decreased tumor burden in lungs when injected intravenously in immunodeficient mice. The cellular effects of CYB5R3 knock-down showed signaling alterations associated with extravasation, TGF$\alpha$ and HIF$\beta$ pathways, and apoptosis. The decreased apoptosis of CYB5R3 knock-down metastatic cancer cell lines was confirmed in functional assays. Our study reveals a central role of CYB5R3 in extravasation/colonization of cancer cells and demonstrates the ability of our quantitative, comparative proteomic approach to identify key proteins of specific important biological processes that may also prove useful as potential biomarkers of clinical relevance.

@ARTICLE{Sahlberg2013,
abstract = {About 20{\%} of breast cancers are characterized by amplification and overexpression of the HER2 oncogene. Although significant progress has been achieved for treating such patients with HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab, more than half of the patients respond poorly or become resistant to the treatment. Since the HER2 amplicon at 17q12 contains multiple genes, we have systematically explored the role of the HER2 co-amplified genes in breast cancer cell growth and their relation to trastuzumab resistance. We integrated aCGH data of the HER2 amplicon from 71 HER2 positive breast tumors and 10 cell lines with systematic functional RNA interference analysis of 23 core amplicon genes with several phenotypic endpoints in a panel of trastuzumab responding and non-responding HER2 positive breast cancer cells. Silencing of HER2 caused a greater growth arrest and apoptosis in the responding compared to the non-responding cell lines, indicating that the resistant cells are inherently less dependent on the HER2 pathway. Several other genes in the amplicon also showed a more pronounced effect when silenced; indicating that expression of HER2 co-amplified genes may be needed to sustain the growth of breast cancer cells. Importantly, co-silencing of STARD3, GRB7, PSMD3 and PERLD1 together with HER2 led to an additive inhibition of cell viability as well as induced apoptosis. These studies indicate that breast cancer cells may become addicted to the amplification of several genes that reside in the HER2 amplicon. The simultaneous targeting of these genes may increase the efficacy of the anti-HER2 therapies and possibly also counteract trastuzumab resistance. The observed additive effects seem to culminate to both apoptosis and cell proliferation pathways indicating that these pathways may be interesting targets for combinatorial treatment of HER2+ breast cancers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play crucial roles in human breast cancer. Although miR-1254 has been shown to have oncogenic activity in several cancer types, its biological function in breast cancer and its mechanisms of action remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-1254 in human breast cancer and sought to elucidate the relevant underlying mechanisms. We found that miR-1254 expression was markedly increased in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Additionally, miR-1254 overexpression accelerated breast cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle G1-S phase transition and inhibited apoptosis. Nevertheless, the inhibition of miR-1254 suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Further analyses revealed that miR-1254 expression negatively correlated with RASSF9 expression in breast cancer tissues. We verified that RASSF9 was a direct target of miR-1254 using a luciferase reporter assay. The overexpression of miR-1254 reduced the RASSF9 mRNA and protein levels, and the suppression of miR-1254 promoted RASSF9 expression. Notably, the knockdown or overexpression of RASSF9 corroborated the biological effects observed upon miR-1254 overexpression or inhibition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that miR-1254 accelerates breast cancer cell growth by activating the AKT signaling pathway and suppresses apoptosis by inhibiting p53 expression through the targeting of RASSF9. The data indicate that miR-1254 plays a crucial role in human breast cancer, and may represent a novel therapeutic target for this malignancy.},

abstract = {Introduction: HER2 gene amplification and protein overexpression (HER2+) define a clinically challenging subgroup of breast cancer with variable prognosis and response to therapy. Although gene expression profiling has identified an ERBB2 molecular subtype of breast cancer, it is clear that HER2+ tumors reside in all molecular subtypes and represent a genomically and biologically heterogeneous group, needed to be further characterized in large sample sets.Methods: Genome-wide DNA copy number profiling, using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), and global gene expression profiling were performed on 200 and 87 HER2+ tumors, respectively. Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) was used to identify significant copy number alterations (CNAs) in HER2+ tumors, which were related to a set of 554 non-HER2 amplified (HER2-) breast tumors. High-resolution oligonucleotide aCGH was used to delineate the 17q12-q21 region in high detail.Results: The HER2-amplicon was narrowed to an 85.92 kbp region including the TCAP, PNMT, PERLD1, HER2, C17orf37 and GRB7 genes, and higher HER2 copy numbers indicated worse prognosis. In 31{\%} of HER2+ tumors the amplicon extended to TOP2A, defining a subgroup of HER2+ breast cancer associated with estrogen receptor-positive status and with a trend of better survival than HER2+ breast cancers with deleted (18{\%}) or neutral TOP2A (51{\%}). HER2+ tumors were clearly distinguished from HER2- tumors by the presence of recurrent high-level amplifications and firestorm patterns on chromosome 17q. While there was no significant difference between HER2+ and HER2- tumors regarding the incidence of other recurrent high-level amplifications, differences in the co-amplification pattern were observed, as shown by the almost mutually exclusive occurrence of 8p12, 11q13 and 20q13 amplification in HER2+ tumors. GISTIC analysis identified 117 significant CNAs across all autosomes. Supervised analyses revealed: (1) significant CNAs separating HER2+ tumors stratified by clinical variables, and (2) CNAs separating HER2+ from HER2- tumors.Conclusions: We have performed a comprehensive survey of CNAs in HER2+ breast tumors, pinpointing significant genomic alterations including both known and potentially novel therapeutic targets. Our analysis sheds further light on the genomically complex and heterogeneous nature of HER2+ tumors in relation to other subgroups of breast cancer. {\textcopyright} 2010 Staaf et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Chemotherapy is the primary established systemic treatment for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in both the early and advanced-stages of the disease. The lack of targeted therapies and the poor prognosis of patients with TNBC have fostered a major effort to discover actionable molecular targets to treat patients with these tumours. Massively parallel sequencing and other 'omics' technologies have revealed an unexpected level of heterogeneity of TNBCs and have led to the identification of potentially actionable molecular features in some TNBCs, such as germline BRCA1/2 mutations or 'BRCAness', the presence of the androgen receptor, and several rare genomic alterations. Whether these alterations are molecular 'drivers', however, has not been clearly established. A subgroup of TNBCs shows a high degree of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes that also correlates with a lower risk of disease relapse and a higher likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy. Proof-of-principle studies with immune-checkpoint inhibitors in advanced-stage TNBC have yielded promising results, indicating the potential benefit of immunotherapy for patients with TNBC. In this Review, we discuss the most relevant molecular findings in TNBC from the past decade and the most promising therapeutic opportunities derived from these data.},
